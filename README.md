## Description
This Macro performs an evaluation to quantify the registration error and to define the quality of alignment numerically across multi-resolution grayscale images. The user will be required to select a low-resolution (LR) image, a high-resolution (HR) image, and a Shape object that defines the region to which the calculation will be applied. The user can specify the scale difference between the LR and HR images by adjusting the kernel size and standard deviation of the Gaussian filter when prompted in the dialog window.
