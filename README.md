Performs an evaluation metric to quantify the registration error and define the quality of alignment numerically To calculate this metric, the high-resolution (HR) image is first downsampled using 3D Gaussian pyramid to create an artificial low-resolution (aLR) image of approximately the same quality as the true LR image. Then, the HR and aLR images are considered perfectly aligned since one is directly derived from the other. Therefore, the difference between the HR image and the aLR image can be considered as a baseline error for different scales. Then, the true LR and the HR images are registered, and their registration error is compared to the baseline error. If the registration error is smaller than the baseline error, then we can consider the multiscale HR-LR pair registration to be sufficiently accurate for subsequent downstream tasks such as super-resolution neural network training.
